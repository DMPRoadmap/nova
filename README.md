# Nova (Networked ORCiD Verification & Access)
This mountable engine gem extends the contributors tab of a DMP in roadmap.

Specifically the user can enter the contributor's ORCID iD, click the button "Search ORCID iD" to retrieve the ORCID record, and then the "Name" and "Email" fields are automatically populated with the relevant ORCID record details.
